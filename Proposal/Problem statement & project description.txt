Problem Statement & Project Description

This project device aims to measure the temperature of a person accurately regardless of the distance of the person to the device.
As we know, if the person is not near to the device, the temperature reading might not be accurate. So, we are taking both the distance and temperature readings and we applied a mathematical function with a reference temperature to get the real and accurate reading of the temperature. The reference temperature is getting from the reading with the closest distance. 

The main components of the project:

Temperature sensor (mlx90614)
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
NodeMCU esp32
RFID RC522 (Magnetic card& Reader)
The progress of the device is as follows: The person must show his ID card to the device so the device will take his temperature and also will record the distance between the person and the device.
 Lastly, the data will be sent to a web server.

The use case specification is shown In this folder and it gives better understanding of the project.
